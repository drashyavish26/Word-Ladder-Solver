## Project Overview

The **Word Ladder Solver** is an intelligent algorithm-based application that finds the shortest transformation sequence between two words of equal length. Using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, a fundamental graph traversal algorithm, this project demonstrates how complex word relationships can be modeled as graph problems and efficiently solved.

### What is a Word Ladder?

A word ladder is a word puzzle where you transform one word into another by changing one letter at a time, with each intermediate step forming a valid word from a dictionary. For example:

```
CAT → COT → COG → DOG
```

This project automates the discovery of such transformation sequences using sophisticated algorithmic techniques.

---

## Problem Statement

Given two words of identical length, find the shortest sequence of valid English words that transforms the start word into the goal word by changing exactly one letter per step. Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary.

**Input:**
- Start word (e.g., "cat")
- Goal word (e.g., "dog")

**Output:**
- Transformation sequence if one exists
- Number of steps required
- Error message if no valid transformation exists

---

## Key Features

✓ **Optimal Path Finding:** Uses BFS algorithm to guarantee the shortest transformation sequence  
✓ **Dictionary Support:** Loads words from external file or uses built-in fallback dictionary  
✓ **Error Handling:** Validates input word lengths and handles missing dictionary files  
✓ **Efficient Neighbor Generation:** Intelligently generates valid word neighbors by single-letter substitution  
✓ **Path Reconstruction:** Rebuilds the complete transformation path from start to goal  
✓ **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line interface for easy interaction

## Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

### Why BFS?

BFS is the optimal choice for this problem because:

1. **Shortest Path Guarantee:** BFS explores nodes level by level, ensuring the first path found is the shortest
2. **Unweighted Graph:** Since each transformation has equal weight (one letter change), BFS is more efficient than Dijkstra's algorithm
3. **Complete Search:** BFS explores all possibilities systematically before declaring failure
4. **Time Efficiency:** O(V + E) complexity, where V is the number of words and E is the number of valid transformations

### Time and Space Complexity

| Aspect | Complexity | Details |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(N × 26 × L) | N = dictionary size, L = word length, 26 letters in alphabet |
| **Space Complexity** | O(N) | For visited set, queue, and parent tracking |
| **Worst Case** | O(N × 26 × L) | When traversing entire dictionary |

## Technical Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Programming Language** | Python 3.7+ |
| **Data Structures** | Deque (from collections), Set, Dictionary |
| **Algorithm** | Breadth-First Search (BFS) |
| **File I/O** | Text file reading (words.txt) |

---

## Code Structure

### Main Components

#### 1. **load_dictionary(word_length)**
Loads a dictionary of words filtered by length. Attempts to read from `words.txt` or uses built-in fallback.

```python
Purpose: Initialize word dictionary
Input: word_length (int) - desired word length
Output: words (set) - set of valid words of specified length
```

#### 2. **get_neighbors(word, dictionary)**
Generates all valid neighboring words by single-letter substitution.

```python
Purpose: Find all words differing by exactly one letter
Input: word (str), dictionary (set)
Output: neighbors (list) - list of valid neighbor words
Logic: 
  - For each position in word
  - Try each letter a-z
  - Check if new word exists in dictionary
  - Add to neighbors if valid and different from original
```

#### 3. **bfs_word_ladder(start, goal, dictionary)**
Core BFS algorithm that finds the shortest transformation path.

```python
Purpose: Find shortest word transformation sequence
Input: start (str), goal (str), dictionary (set)
Output: path (list) - transformation sequence or None
Algorithm:
  - Initialize queue with start word
  - Mark start as visited
  - Set start's parent as None
  - While queue not empty:
    - Get front element
    - If equals goal, break
    - For each neighbor not visited:
      - Mark as visited
      - Set current as parent
      - Add to queue
  - Reconstruct and return path
```

#### 4. **reconstruct_path(parent, start, goal)**
Rebuilds the transformation sequence from the parent tracking dictionary.

```python
Purpose: Convert parent pointers to actual transformation path
Input: parent (dict), start (str), goal (str)
Output: path (list) - sequence from start to goal or None
Logic:
  - Check if goal is reachable
  - Traverse from goal backwards using parent pointers
  - Reverse final path to get start→goal order
```
